# 11ty-tutorial
this is a test site where i'm following [this tutorial](https://learn-eleventy.pages.dev/) to setup my first 11ty site. if it works i'll integrate lunr to add a search function. once tested, i'll make a site for locally displaying a tweet dataset without distribution. 

## dev notes
### 2025-03-19
- am struggling to get `gulp-imagemin` to work; lesson 21. decided to not implement this and try using the pkg again in another project. 
- i decided to drop fonts bc the `get-google-fonts` pkg is old and alternatives look like they require some figuring out; lesson 20.
 
 ### 2025-03-10
- i got the pagination to work. we have a feed, too.
- pause structure dev and check styling basics. paused at lesson #12 of tutorial.    

### 2025-03-09
- for some reason the `async ()` in studio.js doesn't work. the file gets parsed, but apparently the function isn't prompted so it never runs. the site i want to retrieve data from is online.

### 2025-03-04
- there's clever uses of 'aria' labels in the tutorial that can be added to improve accesibility and UX.
- the `_data` folder is where i'd put json files with twitter data.
