# 11ty-tutorial
this is a test site where i'm following [this tutorial](https://learn-eleventy.pages.dev/) to setup my first 11ty site. if it works i'll integrate lunr to add a search function. once tested, i'll make a site for locally displaying a tweet dataset without distribution. 

## dev notes
### 2025-03-04
- there's clever uses of 'aria' labels in the tutorial that can be added to improve accesibility and UX.
- the `_data` folder is where i'd put json files with twitter data.
